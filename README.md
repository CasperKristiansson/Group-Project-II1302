Our goal is to create an application that can through machine learning predict upcoming weather / weather phenomenons. The application will receive its data from a simulated IoT-device that can measure certain weather parameters such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. 
There are existing weather applications available. However, most of these do not use historical data in order to predict the most likely weather conditions. Also, this project will use its own simulation for predicting the weather unlike most other weather apps out there.
